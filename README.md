This notebook contains the code for defining a severity scale of racially charged sentiment using keywords. A GPT-based language model is used to classify Trump’s posts from 90 days surrounding the 2024 presidential election according to racism level, using sentiment and contextual analysis. The frequency and proportion of posts that fall under each racism level is calculated by platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Truth Social, Twitter). The platforms that contain variation in levels of severity of racial sentiment are selected for further analysis. A time series analysis for those platforms is conducted to identify patterns in racially motivated sentiment usage across the election timescale.

Graphs created
- Proportion of Platforms by Racism Level
- Racism Level of Trump's Posts on Twitter Across the Election Timescale
- Racism Level of Trump's Posts on Truth Social Across the Election Timescale
